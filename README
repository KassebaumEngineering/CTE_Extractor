The CTE Extractor program is a program written in ANSI C that 
can extract the data from CTE128 and CTE64 tape 
data files.  It has (so far) only been tested on CTE64, however.

The usage and command line arguments are given below:

Usage: cte [args] < input data_file > output data_file
Where args are one or more of:
 -h            prints this help message and exits.
 -v            verbosely prints out data
 -s            prints statistics
 -q            quiet - supresses some error messages.
 -i            ignore - ignore bad checksums.
 -o <format>   output style (on of: ascii, binary, debug, channel <int>)
	       ( default ascii ).

 input data_file  -  A file of CTE tape data
 output data_file -  A file in the selected output format

In testing, I noticed that many of the checksum errors were caused by 
single bit errors in the data stream.  Therefore, most of the time it seems
to be safe to use the "-i" ignore checksum error flag.  Also, there were a 
few cases where a whole byte was missing in the data stream.  I have attempted
to compensate for this.  Likewise, an error in the time field has been seen
occasionally.  I have sttempted to compensate for this as well.  

It would be very easy to modify the program to output in a new custom
format.  A new output subroutine must be written, and a new command line
flag added - or replace one of the current formats.  Comments are in
the code which designate where to add code.

Current output formats:

Ascii: (all data items are sequences of ascii characters)
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> ...
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> <EOF>

Binary: (all data items are in 32 bit floating point)
> linesize_in_bytes
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> ...
> index time channel1 channel2 ... channel64
> <EOF>

Channel: (all data items are in 32 bit floating point)
> float float .... float 
> <EOF>
